<p id="welcome-text">Here, I have arranged an assortment of politicians and how I feel about them.
They are sorted in order of politicians I am least worried about to those I am most worried about.
If you don't feel comfortable with my radical views, feel free to go to someone else's website.  I
am not a sellout to the corporate world quite yet, and I don't owe advertisers anything.  Page hits
are not a requirement of mine, since I am only spending a little over 99 cents to keep this page operational.</p>
